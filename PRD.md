- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite 7.3.1** - Build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first styling

#### 3D Rendering
- **@mkkellogg/gaussian-splats-3d** - Gaussian Splatting library
- **Three.js r182** - 3D rendering engine (peer dependency)
- **WebGL** - GPU-accelerated rendering

#### Performance Monitoring
- **Performance API** - Frame timing, memory usage
- **Custom Metrics Hooks** - Real-time FPS, variance calculations

### Component Architecture

```

    └── index.ts                    # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Key Design Patterns

#### 1. Sibling DOM Structure (Critical Architecture)
**Problem Solved:** The @mkkellogg/gaussian-splats-3d library uses `container.innerHTML = ''` during initialization, which destroys all child React elements.

**Solution:**
```jsx
<div className="outer-wrapper">
  {/* Viewer container - ONLY viewer canvas */}
  <div ref={containerRef} />

  {/* UI overlays as SIBLINGS - safe from innerHTML destruction */}
  {loading && <LoadingOverlay />}
  {error && <ErrorOverlay />}
  <NavigationHints />
</div>
```

**Impact:** Enables safe addition of UI overlays without breaking the viewer.

#### 2. Independent Viewer State Management
- Each viewer (A/B) maintains independent state
- Separate metric tracking per viewer
- No shared state to prevent cross-contamination

#### 3. Custom Hooks for Separation of Concerns
- `useGSLoader`: Handles viewer lifecycle, file loading, cleanup
- `useMetrics`: Tracks performance metrics, calculates statistics

## Feature Specifications

### File Loading System

**Requirements:**
- Must support drag-and-drop and click-to-browse
- Must validate file extensions before loading
- Must show clear error for invalid files
- Must display progress during load (0-100%)
- Must handle large files (>100MB) gracefully

**Edge Cases:**
- Invalid file format → Show error message
- Corrupted file → Show error with details
- File too large → Allow load, monitor memory
- Network interruption (if remote URLs added) → Retry logic

### Metrics Calculation

**FPS Calculation:**
```javascript
FPS = 1000 / averageFrameTime
```

**1% Low FPS:**
- Collect all frame times over measurement period
- Sort frame times (worst to best)
- Take worst 1% of frames
- Calculate average FPS of those frames

**Frame Time Variance:**
- Standard deviation of frame times
- Indicates rendering consistency

**Memory Tracking:**
- Sample `performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize` every second
- Display in MB (bytes / 1024 / 1024)
- Chrome only (graceful degradation)

### Comparison Logic

**Color Coding Rules:**
| Metric | Green (Splat A Better) | Red (Splat B Better) |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|
| FPS | A > B | A < B |
| Frame Time | A < B | A > B |
| Memory | A < B | A > B |
| 1% Low FPS | A > B | A < B |
| Variance | A < B | A > B |
| Load Time | A < B | A > B |
| File Size | A < B | A > B |

**Threshold:** Differences <1% shown as gray (negligible)

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours (UI only), 2-3 weeks (full system)

### Medium Priority

#### 5. WASD FPS-Style Camera Controls
**Status:** Technical constraints identified, deferred

**Description:** Add keyboard controls for FPS-style camera movement:
- W - Move forward (into scene)
- S - Move backward (out of scene)
- A - Strafe left
- D - Strafe right

**Target Use Case:** Users familiar with game engines (Unity, Unreal) prefer keyboard navigation

**Technical Challenge Summary:**

After 5 implementation attempts, the following blocker was identified:

**Root Cause:** The @mkkellogg/gaussian-splats-3d library has built-in WASD controls that cannot be safely disabled at the React component level due to initialization timing issues.

**Attempts Made:**
1. **Attempt 1-3:** Failed due to `container.innerHTML = ''` destroying React elements
   - **Solution Found:** Sibling DOM structure (now implemented)

2. **Attempt 4-5:** Failed due to `stopListenToKeyEvents()` timing issue
   - **Error:** `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'removeEventListener')`
   - **Cause:** OrbitControls not fully initialized when trying to disable built-in WASD
   - **Root Issue:** The controls.stopListenToKeyEvents() method expects listeners to be set up via listenToKeyEvents(window) first, but calling it during React effect lifecycle creates race condition

**Research Completed:**
- Deep analysis of OrbitControls source code (14,000+ lines)
- Identified correct API calls: `stopListenToKeyEvents()`, `camera.position`, `controls.target`, `controls.update()`
- Understood FPS-style movement pattern (move camera + target together)
- Confirmed need to keep movement horizontal (forward.y = 0)

**Recommended Approach (Future):**
1. **Option A:** Fork @mkkellogg/gaussian-splats-3d library
   - Modify OrbitControls initialization to expose keyboard disable option earlier
   - Maintain as separate dependency

2. **Option B:** Create custom OrbitControls wrapper
   - Bypass library's built-in controls entirely
   - Full control over keyboard input
   - More maintenance overhead

3. **Option C:** Wait for library update
   - Submit feature request to library author
   - Add initialization hook for keyboard control customization

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days (including testing)

**Priority:** Medium (nice-to-have, mouse controls work well)

#### 6. Custom Benchmark Scenarios
- **Description:** Define test scenarios (orbit path, zoom sequence)
- **Features:**
  - Record camera movements
  - Replay for consistent testing
  - Compare same viewpoints across files
- **Use Case:** Reproducible benchmarks

#### 7. Quality Metrics Beyond Arena Mode
- **Description:** Image quality assessment beyond performance
- **Potential Metrics:**
  - Visual fidelity score
  - Artifact detection
  - Compression loss visualization
- **Use Case:** Quality vs performance trade-off analysis

### Low Priority

#### 8. Cloud File Support
- **Description:** Load files from URLs (Google Drive, S3, etc.)
- **Features:**
  - URL input field
  - CORS handling
  - Progress indicator
- **Use Case:** Sharing test files without downloads

#### 9. Session Persistence

- **Features:**
  - LocalStorage or IndexedDB
  - Resume previous comparison
  - History of tests
- **Use Case:** Long-running comparisons

## Technical Constraints & Known Issues

### Current Limitations

1. **Browser Compatibility**
   - **WebGL Requirement:** All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - **Memory API:** Chrome only for memory tracking
   - **Graceful Degradation:** Memory metrics show "N/A" in other browsers

2. **File Size Limits**
   - **Browser Limit:** No hard limit, but browser tab may crash with very large files (>500MB)
   - **Recommendation:** Test with files <200MB for stability
   - **Future:** Add file size warning

3. **Mobile Support**
   - **Status:** Not optimized
   - **Issues:** Touch controls work but metrics panel layout not responsive
   - **Future:** Mobile-specific layout

4. **Single Viewer Instance per Pane**
   - **Limitation:** Cannot overlay multiple splats in one viewer
   - **Workaround:** Use two panes for comparison
   - **Future:** Multi-splat overlay mode

### WASD Keyboard Controls - Detailed Technical Analysis

**Status:** Blocked by library architecture
**Attempts:** 5 failed implementations
**Time Invested:** ~4 hours research + implementation

**Timeline of Attempts:**

| Attempt | Date | Approach | Result | Root Cause |
|---------|------|----------|--------|------------|
| 1 | 2026-01-14 | Inline keyboard handler in GSViewer | Blank screen | `container.innerHTML = ''` destroyed React elements |
| 2 | 2026-01-14 | Separate useKeyboardControls hook file | 404 error + blank screen | File creation issue + innerHTML problem |
| 3 | 2026-01-14 | Re-research and inline implementation | Blank screen | Same innerHTML issue |
| 4 | 2026-01-15 | Post sibling-structure fix attempt | Blank screen | Still affected by re-renders |
| 5 | 2026-01-15 | Final attempt with all research fixes | Model visible for split second, then blank | `stopListenToKeyEvents()` called before controls initialized |

**Key Discovery - Sibling Structure Fix:**
Between attempts 3 and 4, we discovered the root cause of viewer fragility:
- **Problem:** `container.innerHTML = ''` in useGSLoader.ts:50 destroys all child elements
- **Solution:** Sibling DOM structure where UI overlays are siblings, not children
- **Impact:** Fixed general UI overlay issue, but WASD still blocked by different problem

**Final Error (Attempt 5):**
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'removeEventListener')
    at OrbitControls.stopListenToKeyEvents
```

**Technical Deep Dive:**

The @mkkellogg/gaussian-splats-3d library internally:
1. Creates OrbitControls with default keyboard listeners
2. Calls `listenToKeyEvents(window)` to set up WASD panning
3. Stores event listener references for cleanup

When we try to disable:
```javascript
viewer.controls.stopListenToKeyEvents(); // Fails!
```

**Why it fails:**
- React effect runs during component lifecycle
- OrbitControls not fully initialized
- `stopListenToKeyEvents()` tries to remove listeners that don't exist yet
- Results in null reference error

**Research Findings:**
- Library source code analysis (gaussian-splats-3d.module.js):
  - Line 12604-12631: OrbitControls setup with `listenToKeyEvents(window)`
  - Line 4821: Built-in key mappings: W=UP, A=LEFT, S=DOWN, D=RIGHT
  - No exposed initialization hook to disable keyboard before setup

**Correct FPS Movement Pattern (researched):**
```javascript
// Calculate forward vector from camera orientation
const forward = new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, -1);
forward.applyQuaternion(camera.quaternion);
forward.y = 0; // Keep horizontal

// CRITICAL: Move camera AND target together
camera.position.add(movement);
viewer.controls.target.add(movement);
viewer.controls.update(); // MUST call update
```

**Conclusion:**
WASD controls are technically feasible but require library-level changes. The built-in controls work well for most use cases. This feature should be revisited if/when the upstream library adds initialization hooks or we decide to fork the library.
